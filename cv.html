I have 10 years of experience in project deployment in consulting and IT operations in Health Care IT. I was accountable for the success of all projects for my clients. In order to achieve success I focused extensively on road mapping, setting expectations, ensuring that lesson learnt were capture and shared, manage risks and issues, improving processes, and increase transparency. **DevOps keywords**<br/><br/>I am really motivated when I learn and grow with a team. Through my previous carreer I quickly endeavour to become a Cerner Command Language Intermediate and Advanced intructor. I lead effort to standardise and document many workflows and knowledge. On my personal time I spent a lot of time learning sailing, and learning all systems on my previous boat in order to achieve a personal goal. I am currently trying to dive again into application devlopment, as well as learning about DevOps and cloud services and architecture.</p></div><div class="utils_lightText__eUzGY"><table><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Oracle (Cerner)" width="144" height="144" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="utils_borderCircle__s2nTm" style="color:transparent" srcSet="https://nicolasgrymonprezblog.imgix.net/images/oraclecerner.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, https://nicolasgrymonprezblog.imgix.net/images/oraclecerner.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;w=384&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://nicolasgrymonprezblog.imgix.net/images/oraclecerner.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;w=384&amp;q=75"/></td><td>Sr. Technical Project Manager</td></tr><tr><td colSpan="2">Responsible for the planning, coordinating, executing, running go-lives of technical projects for three major Oracle Cerner hosted clients in Australia.

This was the first RHO flip from HTS, and this included the first CAMM images migration to the cloud (CAMM7). In addition to those unknown challenges from being first in country, the project was delivered 100% remotely from Australia, India, the US, and during the pandemic lockdowns. I am also looking at standardising our deliverables by enhancing our internal documentation, defining workplan / project plans, and promoting internal tools to that effect (JiraHelper, ACME, Github, Config as Code, Chef). Working with live environments and the largest Cerner client outside of the US made me realize the need for strong monitoring tools.
