My previous blog which hadn't been updated since 2016 was using it. I decided to check what it would take to re-use <a href="nicolas.grymonprez.com">nicolas.grymonprez.com</a>.</p>
<p>This can be achieved in a few way, you can point you domain, subdomain to the GitHub Page and update the GitHub Page custom domain settings. This really handy post allowed me to do that: <a href="https://da-sha1.me/configuration/2019/03/03/redirect-custom-domain-to-github-pages.html">Redirect custom domain to github pages</a>.
However this was coming with a con that would not allow me to use another domain for another project. I am not sure if i would need it for any future projects but that's not something I wanted to trade of. Since my domain name comes with a hosting space, ftp and database I decided to use that.</p>
<p>My hosting provider is OVH and I quickly found
<a href="https://github.com/pitscher/ovh-deploy-hosting-action">OVH deploy hosting action</a>. However, after looking into <a href="https://github.com/Nyc0/ovh-deploy-hosting-action/blob/master/entrypoint.sh">entrypoint.sh</a> I understood that it was not doing what I wanted. It's not actually deploying the static website. I could have looked at creating and action and updating it but I looked for a FTP action instead. I will keep this as an simple example on how an action template can work.</p>
<p>Custom <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ftp-deploy">FTP action</a> to upload the generatic static website to a remote server was easy to set up. I am still trying to figure out an issue with ftps.
Since my hosting was set up against my WordPress website, I had to configure the URL to point to a different directory within the www directory. I used <a href="https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/hosting/multisites-configuring-multiple-websites/#step-1-access-multisite-management">Multisites configuration</a> wiki page to achieve it.</p>
<p>Once set up I had CSS issues. The CSS wasn't loading as the HTML was looking for the code withing my GitHub repo name. Since I was initially deploying the website to GitHub pages I had to update the assetPrefix and basePath when the build process was ran by a GitHub action.</p>
<pre><code>const¬†isGithubActions¬†=¬†process.env.GITHUB_ACTIONS¬†||¬†false

if (isGithubActions) {
  // trim off `&#x3C;owner>/`
  const repo = process.env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY.replace(/.*?\//, '')

  assetPrefix = `/${repo}/`
  basePath = `/${repo}`
}
</code></pre>
<p>Removing the variable and if statement would solve the issue. However I wanted to keep the GitHub Page, maybe as a disaster recovery option üòÖ.</p>
<p>Here is my updated code with a new variable and an updated logical condition.</p>
<pre><code>const isFTPVersion = const isFTPVersion = process.env.ftpVersion || false

if (isGithubActions &#x26;&#x26; !isFTPVersion) {
</code></pre>
<p>process.env.ftpVersion has to be added a <a href="https://github.com/Nyc0/nextjs-blog/blob/main/.github/workflows/ftp-blog.yml">ftp-blog.yml</a> and since I wanted to keep deploying to GitHub pages, I created another Build and Deploy workflow to FTP the newly build website that isn't definying assetPrefix and basePath.</p>
<p>A push to the main branch starts <a href="https://github.com/Nyc0/nextjs-blog/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-and-deploy-blog.yml">build-and-deploy-blog.yml</a>, which then use workflow <a href="https://github.com/Nyc0/nextjs-blog/blob/main/.github/workflows/ftp-blog.yml">ftp-blog.yml</a>. The hiccup I encountered was related to the unavailability of the repository secrets. This was fixed after reading the following help page: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows">reusing workflows</a>. The secret either have to be inherited or passed to the reused workflow, I have decided to explicitly pass it.</p>
