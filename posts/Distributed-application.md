A lot has changed since I was a Java software engineer. I have always kept my interest in coding, but this was limited to internal tools, script creation/improvements, troubleshooting etc.

At Cerner, I had been developing and maintaining a tool to manage client roadmaps in Excel VB! I now want to explore how this could look like as a web distributed application. Plenty of companies are providing tools to manage road maps, this long-term project is purely for my enjoyment.
