Improving on the NVC static webpage scraper that I initially created, I wanted to create a dynamic scraper and display data over time. Since I have a keen interest in what Tesla is doing, I focused on their configuration pages.

Trackers:
- Model S 
- [Model 3](https://nyc0.github.io/nextjs-blog/md3)
- Model X 
- [Model Y](https://nyc0.github.io/nextjs-blog/mdy)

How to they work?
